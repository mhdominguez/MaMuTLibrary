# MaMuTLibrary
MaMuT Dataset Manipulation Script Library

These Perl scripts are used to filter, color, annotate, filter, subset, merge, and export track data from MaMuT datasets in order to visualize or quantify cell behaviors.

## MaMuT split dataset by manual color (or tissue type)
### Splits a MaMuT dataset into separate datasets, with tracks allocated by MANUAL_COLOR or TISSUE_TYPE annotations
 usage: `perl MaMuT_dataset_split_manual_color.pl dataset_mamut.xml`<br>
### this is the quick-n-dirty version of the script and does not exhaustively ensure that entire tracks stay together -- therefore it is best used for SVF2MM output where TISSUE_TYPE is forward propagated through each entire track
### note this script uses 8 threads in parallel, and requires package libparallel-forkmanager-perl on Ubuntu


## MaMuT split dataset by manual color (or tissue type)
### Splits a MaMuT dataset into separate datasets, with tracks allocated by MANUAL_COLOR or TISSUE_TYPE annotations
 usage: `perl MaMuT_dataset_split_manual_color.pl dataset_mamut.xml`<br>
### note this script is single-threaded and slow!


## MaMuT split dataset by tracks, randomly into X bins
### Splits a MaMuT dataset into separate datasets, with tracks allocated randomly among the bins
 usage: `perl MaMuT_dataset_split_random_subgroups.pl dataset_mamut.xml X`<br>
	where X is the desired number of bins<br>
### note this script is single-threaded and slow!


## MaMuT split dataset by timepoints
### Splits a MaMuT dataset into two datasets, one containing spots and tracks bounded by start/stop, the other with spots that are out-of-bounds
 usage: `perl MMaMuT_dataset_split_spot_timepoint.pl dataset_mamut.xml start=0 stop=40`<br>
	where 0 and 40 create the timepoint bounds for the resulting dataset<br>
### note this script is relatively fast, since it just splits the spots and doesn't really reconstruct lineages -- user may need to open and re-save the dataset in order for everything to work properly after splitting by timepoint


## MaMuT split dataset by track filter(s)
### Filter a MaMuT dataset by splitting into 2 datasets (.0.xml and .1.xml), with .0.xml containing rejected tracks/cells, and .1.xml containing filtered tracks/cells according to criteria specified...

### note this script is single-threaded and slow!


## MaMuT split dataset by XYZ coordinates into bins, backwards in time
### Splits MaMuT dataset into n bins by dividing it into mean/stdev or percentile bins along a particular axis, using chronologic last cell in the track to assign the bin

### Subtracts spots from a MaMuT dataset, with spots inputted from file(s) in radius annotation CSV format: Annotation,Timepoint,Position_T,ID
 usage: `perl MaMuT_dataset_subtract_spots_quickndirty.pl dataset_mamut.xml spots1.txt spots2.txt spots3.txt ...`<br>
